            <h1 class="pTitle"> My portfolio game, and deep-end introduction to object-oriented programming. </h1>
            <p id = "lorem0">
                If you're new to programming, or have only worked with procedural programming languages, object-oriented programming can seem daunting. However, with practice and some patience, you can master the basics and use them to create exciting and complex projects.
            </p>
            <p>    
                One such project is the game I recently created using Python and the pygame library. In this game, I used object-oriented programming to create different classes for the character, the buildings, and the items the player can interact with. This allowed me to create a modular and scalable game that could easily be expanded upon.
            </p>
            <p>    
                In my prior experience as a telecommunications technician, I had never written a line of object-oriented Python. However, after some self-learning, and using experience that I have in C++ and Java, I was able to quickly get up to speed on the basic concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
            </p>
            <p>   
                One of the main advantages of using object-oriented programming is the ability to encapsulate data and functionality within classes. This makes it easier to manage and organize code, and makes it less prone to errors and bugs. In my game, I used this concept to create a separate class for each building, which contained information about the building and its contents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another advantage of using object-oriented programming is the ability to create modular and reusable code. For example, in my game, I created a separate class for the character's movement, which I could easily reuse in other parts of the game. This made it easier to maintain and modify the code as the game grew in complexity.
            </p>
            <p>    
                Finally, I used an open source project called "pygbag" to build my Python game into webasm and integrate it into my website. This allowed me to share my game with a wider audience and showcase my skills to potential employers and clients.
            </p>
            <p>    
                In conclusion, using object-oriented programming in Python allowed me to create a scalable and modular game that could easily be expanded upon. Through this project, I learned the basics of object-oriented programming and how to apply them to real-world projects. If you're new to object-oriented programming, I encourage you to give it a try and see how it can enhance your coding skills and projects.</p>
